  \begin{itemize}
  \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
  \item If you don't ``believe'' in evolution...
  \item Kahneman: Behavioral Economics, behavioral psychology, decision making
  \item Introducing: modular theory of mind
    \begin{itemize}
    \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
    \item {\it Kind of} like apps
    \item Apps that interact, compete, interrelate, self-manage(?)
    \item Not a physical partition of brain
    \item e.g. small heat robot
    \item Different parts of the brain evolved at different times, with new functions added on later, melding with existing ones...

\begin{frame}{Thinking, ``Fast and Slow''}{Old and New}
\begin{itemize}
\addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
\item Kahneman calls them ``System 1'' and ``System 2''
\item Evolutionarily old and new
    \begin{itemize}
    \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
    \item Old: amygdala (?) --- fast circuitry; closer to the stock exchange
    \item New: prefrontal cortex --- reflection, abstract thinking, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\item Not the same thing---equating amygdala/prefrontal to fast/slow---but that's the idea behind the more complex underlying brain reality.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fast and Slow: System 1 and System 2}
\begin{itemize}
\addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
\item Evolutionarily: old System 1, and new System 2
\item e.g.
    \begin{itemize}
    \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
    \item System 1: ``I can't believe that f****r cut me off!! I'll club him!!''
    \item System 2: ``Then again, maybe he really needed to get over; plus, I don't want to go to jail.''
    \end{itemize}
\item e.g. 2
    \begin{itemize}
    \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
    \item System 1: Recognizing emotions in facial expressions
    \item System 2: 17*34 = ?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's the point?}{}
\begin{itemize}
\addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
\item Cognitive biases.
\item Humans commit systematic errors of (rational) thinking.
\item We're irrational in systematic ways.
\item Middle three (of five) sections of book:
    \begin{itemize}
    \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
    \item Heuristics and Biases
    \item Overconfidence (personal favorite)
    \item Choices

\begin{frame}{Heuristics and Biases}{Statistical Thinking}
\begin{itemize}
\addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
\item What is a heuristic? A rule of thumb, more or less. (!!)
\item Kahneman and Tversky -- best friends, walks, thought experiments of a kind; so, here we go...
\item ``A study of new diagnoses of kidney cancer in the 3,141 counties of the United States reveals a remarkable pattern. The counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is lowest are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South, and the West. What do you make of this?''
\item What {\it do you} make of this?

  \end{itemize}
\item Associative, causal-relationship-seeking, story-telling System 1 goes bananas! 
\item Answer: small samples yield extreme results more frequently.
\item What's happening (with System 1) in these situations {\it instead} of statistical thinking? (or whatever other System 2 operations)
\item Let's look at one example System 1 pair in action...
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Heuristics and Biases}{e.g. Substitution, Availability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Question: which is more likely cause of death, and by what ratio? 
    \begin{itemize}

    \item Lightning or botulism? 
    \item Accidents or diabetes?

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Heuristics and Biases}{e.g. Substitution, Availability}
\begin{itemize}
\addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}

  \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
  \item How likely is your plane to crash?
  \item How likely is a school shooting at the local school?
  \end{itemize}
\item Common answer much higher than true answer because:
  \begin{itemize}
  \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5\baselineskip}
  \item Substitution---answer easier question: how easy is it to recall instances of such events?
  \item Availability bias---quite easy, b/c media coverage makes crashes and shootings easy to recall
  \item Ease of recall replaces actual likelihood estimation $\rightarrow$ people think these events are more likely than they are.
